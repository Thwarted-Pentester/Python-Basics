# Python Basics

This repository is a concise yet comprehensive guide tailored for beginners to learn the essentials of Python programming. It covers fundamental topics such as variables, loops, functions, data structures, if statements, and file handling. And also I uploaded a PDF file for proper code and notes [https://github.com/Thwarted-Pentester/Python-Basics/blob/main/Python%20Basics.pdf](Python Basics.pdf) 

## Variables

Learn how to declare and utilize variables in Python to store and manipulate data, including different data types and variable naming conventions.

## Loops

Master loop structures like `for` and `while` loops in Python, understanding their syntax and applications for iterating over sequences or executing code repeatedly.

## Functions

Understand the concept of functions in Python, including function definition, parameters, return values, and how to write modular and reusable code using functions.

## Data Structures

Explore Python's built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, learning their properties, methods, and practical usage scenarios.

## If Statements

Learn how to use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) in Python to control the flow of your programs based on different conditions.

## Files

Discover how to read from and write to files in Python, including different file modes, handling file paths, and common file manipulation operations.
